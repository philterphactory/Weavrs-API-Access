Weavrs API Access For Data Visualization
========================================

This Prosthetic is for generating Gelphi [https://gephi.org](https://gephi.org/) visualisations of Weavrs.

Instructions
============

Register a prosthetic at [www.weavrs.com](http://.weavrs.com/)

Copy config.py.in as config.py and fill it out with your prosthetic's keys.

Run:

	python oauthorize.py

And authorize a Weavr. The OAuth keys for this authorization will be printed
on the command line. Copy these somewhere you won't lose them.

Next run:

     python dump.py KEY SECRET

This will create .gexf files of graphs of the keywords and emotions.
