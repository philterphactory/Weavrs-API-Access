Weavrs API Access For Data Visualization
========================================

Register a prosthetic at www.weavrs.com

Copy config.py.in as config.py and fill it out with your prosthetic's keys.

Run:

	python oauthorize.py

And authorize a weavr. The OAuth keys for this authorization will be printed
on the command line. Copy these somewhere you won't lose them.

Next run:

     python keywords.py KEY SECRET

This will crate a .gexf file of a graph of the keywords.
